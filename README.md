EmojiTarot has 3 layers which apply as code examples for the aspiring AI developer.

1. CGI component
2. DOM component
3. Ollama.ai component

## CGI
The CGI component was generated with GPT4 and is an example of pre-rendering with AI to rapidly develop the input section of the prompt.

## DOM
The DOM fetches the CGI info based on a random number generator, and uses this as input for the AI prompt. This is where the 'personality' of the website in question is built

## Ollama.ai
This project enables a developer to run AI models on their home lab or private hardware thus enabling privacy and affordability while the market is built.
