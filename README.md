Currently this code base is for study. To build and run it you would need to build and route ollama.ai to a public endpoint. 
In the coming weeks we will be working on this to make it as turn-key as possible. Stay tuned. Please enjoy the examples. 

A live example can be found at https://emojitarot.xyz
